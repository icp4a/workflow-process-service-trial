For more information about the new `docker compose` command, see [Overview of Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command).\n\n You can also use Docker Compose version 1.27.3 or later, but for those versions, you can only use the `docker-compose` command. \n \n**Note**: Docker Compose version 1 is deprecated.

Go to Docker -> Preferences -> Resources and ensure that you have at least 2 CPUs, 3.00 GB memory, and 1 GB swap. |\n| Windows | [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install). If you are using Hyper-V, increase the Hyper-V memory to 3 GB. If you are using WSL, make sure you have at least 3 GB free memory.|\n\n\nNext, [obtain an IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) if you don't have one and follow the [guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key) to create an API key to access the IBM Cloud Container Registry.\n\nUse the API key to log in to the IBM Cloud Container Registry by running the following Docker command:\n\n```\ndocker login -u iamapikey -p <apikey> icr.io\n```\nReplace `<apikey>` with your API key.\n\nTo install offline, see [Offline Installation](/offline). If you created process applications in an earlier version, see [Migrating to a new version](/migrating).\n\n## Starting the Workflow Process Service Trial environment\n\n1. Create a folder on your local computer, such as `sample/folder`, where you will run Docker Compose.\n\n2. In the new folder, create a new file named `docker-compose.yml`. Copy the contents of the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/icp4a/workflow-process-service-trial/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file into the new file on your local computer and save it.\n\n3. Optional: By default, the Workflow Process Service Trial environment uses localhost. If you want to access IBM Workplace or Business Automation Studio from a web browser that's not running on the Docker host, go to [Customizing the hostname](customizing#customizing-the-hostname-and-port).\n\n4. Run `docker-compose up`. Don't interrupt this command when it's running. You can add the -d parameter to keep it running in the background. Always use this parameter on Mac.\n\nRunning in the background:\n\n```bash\ncd <sample folder you created>\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nRunning interactively:\n\n```bash\ncd <the folder you created>\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\n## Verifying the installation\n\nAfter you run the `docker-compose up` command, you can monitor the output of the command. It pulls the Trial image from the registry and then starts Workflow Process Service. \n\nThe server needs time to initialize. It's ready when you see messages such as:\n \n   `The system maintenance monitor is determining if maintenance is required. The system is in an OK state. `\n\nTo see the logs, run:\n   \n```\ndocker logs pc -f\n```\n\nThe default value for the container name is `pc`. If you change the container_name property in the `docker-compose.yml` file before you start the environment, replace pc with the actual container name you defined.\n\n\n## Getting started \n\nTo get the URLs that you can access, as well as the admin user name and password, run:\n\n\n```\ndocker exec pc /scripts/post-deployment.sh\n```\n\nKeep a copy of the admin password. In keeping with IBM security policy, the password is generated for you. The default username is admin. \n\nFollow the links in the output of the command to access Workplace and Business Automation Studio. The default URLs are:\n- Workplace: https://localhost:9443/Workplace\n- Studio: https://localhost:9443/BAStudio\n- Process Admin Console: https://localhost:9443/ProcessAdmin\n\n**Note**: To use Chrome on Mac, see `Can't access Workplace or Business Automation Studio using Chrome on Mac` in [troubleshooting](/troubleshooting#cant-access-workplace-or-business-automation-studio-using-chrome-on-mac).\n\n**Remember**: The embedded database provided by Workflow Process Service Trial doesn't support data encryption, so don't store any sensitive data.\n\n### Predefined hiring sample process\n\nThere is a predefined process instance running in the Workflow Process Service Trial container. To see it, go to  `https://<EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME>:<EXTERNAL_HTTPS_PORT>/Workplace` and check the process instance status. The process instance will be \"overdue.\"\n\n### Predefined users and groups\n\nThe server is configured by default with the following predefined users and groups:\n\n``` \n    Group \"employee\", members:  employee1\n                                employee2\n                                employee3\n     Group \"manager\", members:  manager1  \n                                manager2\n\t\t\t        manager3\n```\n\nThe passwords for these users are randomly generated, the same as the admin password. \n\n## Stopping and restarting the environment\n\nTo stop the environment, run:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose stop\n```\n\nTo start the environment, run:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose start\n```\n\nTo restart the environment, run:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose restart\n```\n\n## Customizing\nTo customize the Workflow Process Server Trial, including persisting data and adding full text search, see [Customizing](/customizing). \n\n## Troubleshooting\nFor any issues, see [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"1940a120765b8d802c4c8771503cabe8","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":519},"frontmatter":{"title":"Installing IBM Workflow Process Service Trial"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Installing IBM Workflow Process Service Trial\n---\n\nIBM Workflow Process Service Trial includes an authoring and runtime environment for a single workflow process.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n| Container Runtime | Version |\n|---|---|\n| Docker | 19.03 or later |\n| Docker Compose | 2.3.3 or later |\n\nIf you follow the official documentation for installing Docker Compose, Docker Compose version 2.3.3 is installed, and you can use the `docker compose` command or the `docker-compose` command.
