Export projects from the installed version of Workflow Process Service Trial.\n     1. Select **Business automations** and select the business automation (automation) you want to export. \n     2. To export a project, select the three-dot icon near **Open** and then select **Export**. To export a version, select the three-dot icon beside the version and select **Export**. You can export the project to be shared, used as a backup, or published. If you don't select a version, the most recent version of the project is exported.
