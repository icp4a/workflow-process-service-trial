For more information about Podman and its commands, see [Podman](https://podman.io/).\n\n| Container runtime enterprise server | Red Hat Enterprise Linux| Ubuntu | SUSE Linux | Windows\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|--------|------------|-----------|\n| Podman               | Version 4.6.1 or later  | 3.4.4 or later | 4.4.4 or later    | |\n| Podman Compose       | 1.0.6 or later          | 1.0.6 or later | 1.0.6 or later    | |\n| Podman Desktop       |          |  |   | v1.5.3 or later |\n\n### Minimum hardware requirements\n\nTo install IBM Workflow Process Service Trial on Podman, you need the following:\n- CPU: At least 0.5 CPU \n- Memory: At least 4 GB\n- Disk: At least 5 GB\n\n## Installing and setting up your environment\n\nTo install and prepare your Podman environment, complete the following steps:\n\n1. Depending on your operating system, install Podman.\n   - For Ubuntu, see [Ubuntu Podman Installation Instructions](https://podman.io/docs/installation#ubuntu) and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose#installation).\n   - For Red Hat, see [RHEL8 Podman Installation Instructions](https://podman.io/docs/installation#rhel8) and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose#installation).\n   - For SUSE Linux, see [openSUSE Podman Installation Instructions](https://podman.io/docs/installation#opensuse) and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose#installation).\n   - For Windows, see [Installing Podman Desktop using the Windows installer](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation/windows-install). After you install Podman Desktop, open the application and complete the instructions in the application to install Podman and Podman Compose.\n\n\n3. If you don't have an IBM Cloud account, register by completing the steps in [Create an IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration). \n\n4. Create an API key for accessing the IBM Cloud Container Registry by completing the instructions in [Creating an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key)\n\n5. Use the API key to log in to the IBM Cloud Container Registry by running the following Docker command:\n\n   ```bash\n   podman login -u iamapikey -p <apikey> icr.io\n   ```\nWhere `<apikey>` is your API key.\n\n## Starting your environment\n\n1. Create a folder on your local computer, where you will run Podman Compose.\n\n2. In the new folder, create a new file named `docker-compose.yml`. Copy the contents of the sample [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/icp4a/workflow-process-service-trial/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file into the new `docker-compose.yml` on your local computer and save it.\n\n3. Optional: By default, the Workflow Process Service Trial environment uses the `localhost` hostname. If you want to access IBM Workplace or IBM Business Automation Studio from a web browser that is not running on the Docker host, complete the steps in [Customizing the hostname](/customizing-podman#customizing-the-hostname-and-port).\n\n4. Start your environment by running the appropriate command for your operating system. Don't interrupt this command when it is running. You can either run the command in the background, or run it interactively.  \n\n   **Note:** For Ubuntu 22.04, you might run into the following error: `ERROR[0046] error loading cached network config: network \"<your_project_name>_default\" not found in CNI cache`. To troubleshoot this error, see [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting-podman#error-loading-cache).  \n\n\n   - If you want your environment to run in the background:  \n\n      - For Linux and Unix:\n\n         ```bash\n         cd <folder_you_created>\n         podman-compose up -d\n         ```\n      - For Windows:  \n\n         ```bash\n         cd <folder_you_created>\n         podman compose up -d\n         ```  \n         \n   - If you want your environment to run interactively:  \n\n      - For Linux and Unix:  \n\n         ```bash\n         cd <folder_you_created>\n         podman-compose up\n         ```\n\n      - For Windows:  \n\n         ```bash\n         cd <folder_you_created>\n         podman compose up\n         ```   \n\n## Verifying the installation\n\nAfter you run the `podman-compose up` command, you can monitor the output. The command pulls the trial image from the registry and then starts Workflow Process Service. \n\nThe server needs time to initialize. It is ready when you see messages such as:\n \n   `The system maintenance monitor is determining if maintenance is required. The system is in an OK state. `\n\nTo see the logs, run the following command. The default value for the container name is `pc`. If you changed the `container_name` property in the `docker-compose.yml` file before you started the environment, replace `pc` with the container name you defined.  \n\n   \n   ```bash\n   podman logs -f pc\n   ```\n\n\n## Getting started \n\nTo get the URLs that you can access, and the admin username and password, run the following command:\n\n\n   ```bash\n   podman exec pc /scripts/post-deployment.sh\n   ```\n\nKeep a copy of the admin password. To align with the IBM security policy, the password is generated for you. The default username is `admin`. \n\nFollow the links in the output of the command to access Workplace and Business Automation Studio. The default URLs are:\n- Workplace: `https://localhost:9443/Workplace`\n- Studio: `https://localhost:9443/BAStudio`\n- Process Admin Console: `https://localhost:9443/ProcessAdmin`\n\nThe embedded database provided by Workflow Process Service Trial does not support data encryption. Do not store sensitive data.\n\n**Note:** To use Chrome on Mac, see `Can't access Workplace or Business Automation Studio using Chrome on Mac` in [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting-podman#cant-access-workplace-or-business-automation-studio-using-chrome-on-mac).\n\n### Predefined hiring sample process\n\nThere is a predefined process instance running in the Workflow Process Service Trial container. To see the predefined process instance, go to `https://<EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME>:<EXTERNAL_HTTPS_PORT>/Workplace` and check the process instance status. The process instance is marked as \"overdue\".\n\n### Predefined users and groups\n\nBy default, the server is configured with the following predefined users and groups:\n\n   ``` \n      Group \"employee\", members:  employee1\n                                  employee2\n                                  employee3\n      Group \"manager\", members:  manager1  \n                                 manager2\n                                 manager3\n   ```\n\nThe passwords for these users are randomly generated. \n\n## Stopping and restarting the environment\n\n   - For Linux and Unix:\n      - To stop the environment, run:  \n\n      ```bash\n      podman-compose stop\n      ```\n      - To start the environment, run:  \n      ```bash\n      podman-compose start\n      ```\n      - To restart the environment, run:  \n      ```bash\n      podman-compose restart\n      ```\n   - For Windows\n      - To stop the environment, run:  \n      ```bash\n      podman compose stop\n      ```\n      - To start the environment, run:  \n      ```bash\n      podman compose start\n      ```\n      - To restart the environment, run:  \n      ```bash\n      podman compose restart\n      ```\n\n\n## Customizing\nTo customize the Workflow Process Server trial, such as persisting data and adding full text search, see [Customizing](/customizing-podman). \n\n## Troubleshooting\nFor issues while installing, see [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting-podman).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"0cfe27002698a221b61c3e95c3374288","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":3707},"frontmatter":{"title":"Installing IBM Workflow Process Service Trial on Podman"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Installing IBM Workflow Process Service Trial on Podman\n---\n\nIBM Workflow Process Service Trial includes an authoring and runtime environment for a single workflow process.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n- [Installing and setting up your environment](#installing-and-setting-up-your-environment)\n- [Starting your environment](#starting-your-environment)\n- [Verifying the installation](#verifying-the-installation)\n- [Getting started](#getting-started)\n- [Stopping and restarting the environment](#stopping-and-restarting-the-environment)\n- [Customizing](#customizing)\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nIf you had previously used the Docker trial, Podman has a Docker-compatible command line to make the transition to Podman easier.
