## Getting started 

To get the URLs that you can access, as well as the admin user name and password, run:


```
docker exec pc /scripts/post-deployment.sh
```

Keep a copy of the admin password. In keeping with IBM security policy, the password is generated for you. The default username is admin. 

Follow the links in the output of the command to access Workplace and Business Automation Studio. The default URLs are:
- Workplace: [https://localhost:9443/Workplace](https://localhost:9443/Workplace)
- Studio: [https://localhost:9443/BAStudio](https://localhost:9443/BAStudio)
- Process Admin Console: [https://localhost:9443/ProcessAdmin](https://localhost:9443/BAStudio)
 
*Note*: The embedded database provided by Workflow Process Service Trial doesn't support data encryption, so don't store any sensitive data.

### Predefined hiring sample process

There is a predefined process instance running in the Workflow Process Service Trial container. To see it, go to  `https://<EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME>:<EXTERNAL_HTTPS_PORT>/Workplace` and check the process instance status. The process instance will be "overdue."

### Predefined users and groups

The server is configured by default with the following predefined users and groups:

``` 
    Group "employee", members:  employee1
                                employee2
                                employee3
     Group "manager", members:  manager1  
                                manager2
			        manager3
```

The passwords for these users are randomly generated, they are the same with admin password.
