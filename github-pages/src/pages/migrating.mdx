title: Migrating applications to a new version of Workflow Process Service Trial
---

If you created process applications in an earlier version of IBM Workflow Process Service Trial, and you want them to work in the current version, you must export the projects from the previous version, install the new version, and import the projects.

Before you export projects, ensure you have read permission or are a repository administrator. For more information, see [Managing access to the repository for business applications](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYHZ8_21.0.3/com.ibm.dba.bas/topics/managinglib_users_B.html).

## Procedure

1. Export projects from the installed version of Workflow Process Service Trial.
     1. Select **Business automations** and select the business automation (automation) you want to export. 
     2. To export a project, select the three-dot icon near **Open** and then select **Export**. To export a version, select the three-dot icon beside the version and select **Export**. 
You can export the project to be shared, used as a backup, or published. If you don't select a version, the most recent version of the project is exported. If a version doesn't exist, you're prompted to create one.
     4. Locate the directory you want to save the exported file in, name the file, and then save it.

2.	Install the new version in a new folder on your computer or on a different computer, by following the instructions in 
[Installing IBM Workflow Process Service Trial](/installing).

3.  Import the projects into the new version of Workflow Process Service Trial.
     1. Select **Business automations**.
     2. Click **Import**. 
     3. Click **Browse** to locate and select the file that you want to import. 

When the import is finished, the imported project is included in the list of **Business automations > Workflow**.

## Publishing a Workflow automation service

If your project contains a Workflow automation service, you can publish a version of it, which publishes all the automation services in it. To see the services in a particular version, select the **Automation Services** tab.

To publish it:

1. Select the Workflow automation that contains the exposed automation services that you want to publish.

2.	On the **Versions** tab, click the three-dot menu of the version you want to publish and select **Publish**. 

3. Verify your business automation can work in the new version of Workflow Process Service Trial,

If needed, you can clean up the previous installation. See [Cleaning up the environment](/customizing#cleaning-up-the-environment).
